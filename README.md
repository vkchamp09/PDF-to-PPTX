- **Temporary PNGs**: The converter saves each page as a temporary PNG image before inserting it into PowerPoint. These files are cleaned up automatically.
- **Aspect Ratio**: The slide height is adjusted automatically to maintain the PDF's original aspect ratio.
- **Threading**: Conversion is performed in a background thread to keep the UI responsive.
